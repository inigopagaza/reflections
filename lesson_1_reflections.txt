- How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It's easier to see small errors, specially the one where the two letters look the same.

- How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Well, the easier you can return to a previous version, the faster you can keep on coding.

- What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: You can decide when to save your work, when you are comfortable with it
Cons: You can easily forget to save your work, if you are in a hurry for example

- Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because when coding you can need to update several files for just one change.

- How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to remember what change did you do and git diff to see the actual lines you changed

- How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It makes you feel safe in case you break everything

- Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Make a backup of my code and look other peoples ideas in other projects.
